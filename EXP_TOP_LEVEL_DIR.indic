The only relevance of this file is its name. the prescence of this file 
indicates that the current directory is the top level directory. the reason 
an environment variable is less feasible is that I might start different 
processes in different shells and I do not want to set a global environment 
variable. for now, any application that wishes to use a global environment 
variable, the recommended name is NEURO_EXPERIMENT_TOP_DIR.
