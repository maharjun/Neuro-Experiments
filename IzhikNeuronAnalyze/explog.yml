  Title      : Initial Experiment Calculating Attraction Basins
  Description: |-2
    ##  Description
    
    This is an experiment calculating Attraction Basins for two neuron models:
    
    1.  The Izhikevich Neuron Model as simulated by my network (half step simul-
        ation)
    2.  The Simple (Single Step) Izhikevich Neuron Model.
    
    ##  Procedure
    
    cd into exp_10_dir, run ./IzhikSetup.py and ./SimpleIzhikSetup.py (need to
    have CMake 3.5 and python 3.5).
    
    Then run the script IzhikNeuronAttBasin.m with the working directory as
    exp_10_dir. Two Plots are generated giving the Attractor Basin in which the
    colors are representative of the distance to the attractor basin (i.e. the
    number of steps taken from that steep to reach the attractor states)
    
    ##  Parameters
    
        Simulation TimeStep = 0.5
        Simulation Grid Resolution (U) = 0.05
        Simulation Grid Resolution (V) = 0.05
        Simulation Grid Range (U) = [-25,35]
        Simulation Grid Range (V) = [-100,30]
    
    ##  Observations
    
    We observe that there exists a bottom bound on U such that below this, for
    ANY value of V (assumed to lie between -100->30V), the neuron spikes.
    
    ##  Inferences
    
    We infer that the earlier observed rebound spiking does really take place.
    It can be seen by considering the case where V is held consistently at -100
    for an extended period of time and then released. In such case, U will settle
    at -20 and it can be quite clearly seen that the point (-20, -100) is a part
    of the Basin of Attraction of the Spiking State.

    stable state of the RS Izhikevich Neuron.
    
    ## Procedure
    
    1.  Change working dir to exp_12_dir
    2.  Run All the Python Setup Files in succession
    3.  Run the MATLAB Script

  Title      : Getting the Distribution of U-V under Poisson Noise
  Description: |-2
    ##  Objective
    
    To observe the distribution of the phase parameters in a group of neurons stim-
    ulated by poisson noise.
    
    ##  Procedure
    
    The given experiment requires the following steps:
    
    1.  Run WorkingMemSetup.py
    2.  Run Generate5HrsSimData.m to generate the simulation data of 5 hours invol-
        ving long term stdp with a weight cap of 8 (stimulated with 1 Hz Poisson
        Noise)
    3.  Run GetUVSpread.m to perform simulation on the above generated network and
        plot the u-v histogram.
    
         *  One can adjust Factor (this is basically the parameter onemsbyTstep)
            to simulate using different resolutions to see the impact.
         *  One may also play with the stimulation frequency. (This is more inter-
            esting)
    
    ##  Default Parameters
    
        onemsbyTstep = 1
        stimulation frequency = 0.3 Hz
    
    ##  Observations:
    
    1.  Maximum probability centers around the stable equilibrium indicating that
        neurons do not fire most of the time.
    2.  With Increase in frequency, we observe a spread in the histogram, however,
        it still appears to be concentrated in the curve that represents the line
        leading into the stable equilibrium.
    3.  If we look at the propagation factor (i.e. Actual Spike Frequency / Random 
        Spike Frequency) then we can observe that with increase in frequency it increases. This is expected as with higher frequency, the probability of PNG's getting activated increases quite rapidly.

  Title      : Viewing Sample Paths in the Izhik Dyn System
  Description: |-2
    ##  Description  ##
    
    In this experiment we plot the paths traced from a variety of initial points 
    to see how the simple Izhikevich model behaves.
    
    ##  Procedure  ##
    
    Run IzhikPathAnalysis.m
    
    ##  Observations  ##
    
    1.  We reinforce the observations of Exp #10 i.e we see that for certani U's 
        spiking occurs for all V's.
    
    2.  We observe that all paths to steady state pass through some common curve.
    
    3.  We see that this curve is approximated well by the curve that is the 
        solution to the equation `0.04V^2 + 5V + 140 - U = 0`.
    
    4.  Upon increasing the value of a, it is seen that this approximation becomes 
        worse, infact for a = 1, the 'pass through some common curve' observation 
        falls apart
