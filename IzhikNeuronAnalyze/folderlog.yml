FolderTitle      : Analysis of the Izhikevich Neuron
FolderDescription: |-2
  This folder contains experiments pertaining to the analysis of the dynamical
  system corresponding to the Izhikevich neuron. The experiments here attempt to
  quantify the spiking characteristic of the neuron in the prescence of various
  currents so that we may achieve some understanding of discerning ability in the
  neuron
