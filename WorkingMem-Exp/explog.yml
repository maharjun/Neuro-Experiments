  Title      : Basic Unstable Working Memory
  Description: |-2
    ##  Description  ##
    
    This experiment is the one that seems to follow Izhikevich's description the
    closest and has parameters adjusted to give the closest result (before blowing
    up).
    
    ##  Procedure  ##
    
    1.  Setup the Experiment by running WorkingMemSetup.py
    2.  If OutputSparse5Hours.mat has not been generated, run Generate5HrsSimData.m
    3.  Run ST_STDP_SpikePlot.m
    
    ##  Simulation Parameters  ##
    
    ###   ST-STDP Parameters   ###
    
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_MaxRelativeInc      = single(2);
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_DecayWithTime       = single(exp(-1/5000));
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_EffectDecay         = single(exp(-1/8));
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_EffectMaxCausal     = single(0.16);
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_EffectMaxAntiCausal = single(0.18);
    
    ###   LT-STDP Parameters   ###
    
        InputStruct.W0                          = single(0);
    
    ###   External Current Parameters   ###
    
        InputStruct.Iext.IExtAmplitude = single(30);
        InputStruct.Iext.AvgRandSpikeFreq = single(0.3);
        
        % External Input Current Pattern
        PatternStringArray = {
            'from 0 onwards every 15s         '
            '    from 0 to 1100ms every 110ms '
            '        from 0 onwards generate 1'
            };
        InputStruct.Iext.IExtPattern = getEmptyIExtPattern();
        InputStruct.Iext.IExtPattern = getIExtPatternFromString(PatternStringArray);
        InputStruct.Iext.IExtPattern.NeuronPatterns = {uint32([1,60])};
    
    ###   Network Parameters   ###
    
        InputStruct.InitialState.Weight(InputStruct.NEnd > 800) = 8;

  Title      : Analyze unstable dynamics by Freezing Weights
  Description: |-2
    ##  Description  ##
    
    Here, we repeat the simulation in Exp #17, consider the tim instants before 
    recall and instability, freeze the network weights (along with ST-STDP 
    weights), to observe the nature of instability.
    
    ##  Procedure  ##
    
    1.  Setup the Experiment by running WorkingMemSetup.py
    2.  If OutputSparse5Hours.mat has not been generated, run Generate5HrsSimData.m
    3.  Run FrozenWeightsPlot.m
    
    ##  Simulation Parameters  ##
    
    Same as Exp #17 except for the following ST-STDP Parameters set to freeze 
    weights.
    
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_DecayWithTime       = single(1);
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_EffectMaxCausal     = single(0);
        InputStruct.ST_STDP_EffectMaxAntiCausal = single(0);
    
    ##  Observations  ##
    
    1.  The intensity in the response appears to be maintained in the abscence of 
        any weight change.
    
    2.  There appears to be a slight correlation between the response to memory 
        and the spiking due to recollection. Im not yet sure if this recollection 
        is sufficient, the only evidence in support of this appears to the be the 
        sharp peaky appearence of correlations as opposed to a broad correlation 
        which would be characteristic of noise.
    
    3.  During Instablity the spiking pattern bears no obvious statistical
        consistency except some weak consistency in the time-Direction. In this case, I am even lesser sure if the recall correlations are of any value because of the increase intnsity of spiking during instability coupled with the non-spiky nature of correlations
    
    ##  Inferences  ##
    
    1.  From the limited evidence above it does appear that at least in the recall 
        before instability state, the non-stimulated spiking has some correlation 
        to the response to the input pattern. However, this merits further investigation in terms of whether the synapses involved in the spike trains correlate or not.
