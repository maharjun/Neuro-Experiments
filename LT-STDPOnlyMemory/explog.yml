  Title      : Initial Experiment
  Description: |-2
    In this experiment we attempt to see how the memory is stored under the influ-
    ence of Long-Term (non time-decaying STDP). The Experiment details are mentio-
    ned below. This configuration is likely to be referred to in subsequent exper-
    iments.
    
    ##  Experiment Setting
    
    ###   Network Configuration
    
        N = 1000;
        E = 0.8;
        WorkingMemNetParams.NExc          = round(N*E);
        WorkingMemNetParams.NInh          = round(N - N*E);
        
        WorkingMemNetParams.F_E           = 100;
        WorkingMemNetParams.F_IE          = 100;
        
        WorkingMemNetParams.InitInhWeight = -5;
        WorkingMemNetParams.InitExcWeight = 6;
        
        WorkingMemNetParams.DelayRange    = 20;    
    
    The Meaning of the above parameters is below:
    
        NExc          - Number of Exc Neurons
        NInh          - Number of Inh Neurons
        F_E           - Exc Neuron Fanout
        F_IE          - Inh->Exc Fanout
        InitInhWeight - Initial Inhibitory Synapse weight (stays unchanged)
        InitExcWeight - Initial Excitatory Synapse weight
        DelayRange    - The range of delays (i.e. 1 to DelayRangems)
    
    ###   Simulation Parameters
    
        InputStruct.onmsbyTstep           = int32(1)
        InputStruct.W0                    = single(0.3);
        InputStruct.Iext.AvgRandSpikeFreq = single(0.3);
        
        W0               - Long Term STDP Weight Increment
        AvgRandSpikeFreq - Average Spiking rate of background Poisson current
    
    ###   Input Current
    
    The Input current is described as follows:
    
        from 0   to 100s, every 10s
            from 0 to 2s, every 200ms
                from 0 onwards generate 1
        from 100s to 200s, every 10s
            from 0 to 2s, every 200ms
                from 0 onwards generate 2
        from 200s to 300s, every 10s
            from 0 to 2s, every 300ms
                from 0 onwards generate 3
            
        Neuron Pattern 1 - Neurons 1->30   one per ms
        Neuron Pattern 2 - Neurons 120->91 one per ms
        Neuron Pattern 3 - Neurons 80->51  one per ms
    
    ##  Observations
    
    1.  __From 0 to 100s -__
        
        In this case, we observe that pattern 1 upon repeated application begins
        to generate a strong consistent spiking in the rest of the network. This
        implies that synapses that correspond to causal effects upon application
        of pattern 1 have been heightened.
    
    2.  __From 100s to 200s__
        
        In this case, upon application of pattern 2, we observe that compared to
        the strength of activity in the case of Pattern 1, this is significantly
        subdued. Moreover, we observe that the strength does not increase with
        time.
    
    3.  __From 200s to 300s__
        
        In this case, we observe a result similar to the case from 100s to 200s
    
    ##  Analysis and Inference
    
    1.  The network adapts its weights in a manner which induces selectivity i.e.
        for patterns that are not pattern 1, the network does not spike as
        vigorously.
    
    2.  However, we notice that even under repeated application of patterns 2 and
        3, the network does not appear to be able to adapt its network to generate
        a strong response aka "remember" the input.
    
    3.  On analysis of the histogram of weights it is seen that in the process of
        developing selectivity for pattern 1, a large number of synapses with
        uncorrelated firing have been pushed down to 0. We may _presume_ that
        among these synapses are those that would have been associated with the
        potential spiking pattern generated by the patterns 2 and 3.
    
    4.  Once these synapses have been depressed, there is no mechanism in the
        current learning rule that enables their reactivation. Hence we see that
        the patterns 2,3 are unable to generate a strong response even on repeated
        application
    
    5.  One may heuristically interpret the above as follows. The pattern 1, upon
        being "remembered", as a result of the non-self-containing nature of the
        STDP rule, ends up using almost all of the "memory locations" in the
        network thereby leaving none for Patterns 2 and 3.

  Title      : Effect of Increased Inhibition
  Description: |-2
    In Experiment #5, we observed the issue of a single pattern using up way too
    many locations to store the pattern. In this experiment, we attempt to allevi-
    ate the problem by increasing the strength of inhibition. Intuitively, this
    limits the total network activity intensity thus containing the total number
    of "memory locations" that are used up by any single pattern. All values here
    are with reference to Experiment #5
    
    ##  Experiment Setting
    
    ###   Network Configuration
    
    The following changes were made:
    
    ```diff
        - WorkingMemNetParams.F_IE          = 100;
        + WorkingMemNetParams.F_IE          = 200;
        
        - WorkingMemNetParams.InitInhWeight = -5;
        + WorkingMemNetParams.InitInhWeight = -10;
    ```
    
    ###   Simulation Parameters
    
    No changes were made here.
    
    ###   Input Current Pattern

        '    from 0 to 2s every 200ms       '
        '        from 0 onwards generate 5  '
        
        Neuron Pattern 1 - Neurons   1 -> 30 , one per ms
        Neuron Pattern 2 - Neurons 120 -> 91 , one per ms
        Neuron Pattern 3 - Neurons  80 -> 51 , one per ms
        Neuron Pattern 3 - Neurons 150 -> 121, one per ms
        Neuron Pattern 3 - Neurons 181 -> 210, one per ms
    
    ##  Observations
    
    1.  __From 0 to 100s -__
        
        In this case, we observe a behavior similar to the previous case i.e. an
        increasing firing rate which culminates in a consistent pattern. However,
        we notice that the intensity of spiking in this case is significantly
        mellowed down as a result of increased inhibition. The effects of this are
        seen below
    
    2.  __From 100s to 200s -__
        
        Here we see that upon the first instance of the pattern, the network
        response is slow. This is expected behavior i.e. the network has learned
        to selectively respond strongly only to pattern 1. However, a marked
        difference is observed when we see that the network response to 2 also
        increases and becomes comparable to the case of pattern 1. i.e. the
        network appears to have the "memory capacity" left to specialize towards
        pattern 2 as well.
    
    3.  __From 200s onwards -__
        
        We continue to notice the above pattern even on application of more
        patterns implying that we have in some sense successfully restricted the
        _"memory cell capturing tendency"_ of each pattern thus enabling the
        network to respond selectivity to multiple patterns.
    
    ##  Analysis and Inference -
    
    We see that Increase in local inhibition is successful in moderating the re-
    source utilization of individual current patterns thus enabling the "storage"
    of (characterized by selective response to) multiple patterns.
    
    However, the above experiment is not conclusive about the following:
    
    1.  What is the limit of storage in this scheme?
    2.  Upon storing additional patterns, by how much is the response to the first
        pattern altered?
    3.  All the patterns currently are spatially distinct (i.e. involve different
        subsets of neurons). Thus temporal selectivity has not been established.
    
    Further experiments will deal with the above issues
